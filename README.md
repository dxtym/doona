## 🧩 What's Doona?

- Doona serves as an AI assistant built by [Dilmurod](https://github.com/thisisdilmurod).
- It was named after the character of Doona! series.

🚧 *Doona was created as a side project so that I can apply the knowledge acquired on real-life cases. As such, I did not bother about performance that much, yet I am open to any suggestions regarding the source code. On top of that, this bot was designed to be used by a single person; as a result, I did not add support for usage by multiple parties. That's for the future!*

## 📌 Features

There are multiple features that Doona supports, to list a few of them:

1. Using generative AI to answer questions based on Llama 🤖
2. Scraping web to display timetable data (daily/weekly) 🔎
3. Providing weather forecast through OpenWeatherMap (hourly/daily) ☁
4. Adding and deleting todo tasks on a custom keyboard 📑
5. Downloading specified YouTube videos with HD support 💻

## ⚙ Plans
If time allows, I'm looking forward to deploy the bot on a VPS/VDS server and add extra functionalities, such as downloading music, notifying updates, etc. 📋
